# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# ced = User.create(username: "bla")
# doc = Doctor.create(name: "Doc", speciality: "Orthi", bill: "1000", image: "Love", location: "Togo", email: "Email@gmail.com", user: ced)
